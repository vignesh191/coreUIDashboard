## Notes Regarding using/editing this "clean" Template
* The _nav.js file has been cleaned from boilerplate code and now simply demonstrates the primary feautures of the side navbar. 
* The routes.js file was originally containing routes to CoreUI's component documentation pages, but has been cleaned out to only route to the Dashboard template, User page template, and a TestPage
* A TestPage view has been added to be used as an example of a starter page, as well as its respective route, and navbar button (see Menu Item 3 in navbar).
UPDATES
* The Dashboard.js now has been remodeled to have a different layout including a 'world view'.
